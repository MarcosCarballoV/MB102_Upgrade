[![Altium Designer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Altium-21.0-blue.svg)](https://www.altium.com/)

## Overview
This project presents a custom PCB design created in Altium Designer, improving upon the original MB102 power supply module. Key upgrades include LiPo battery support, dynamic power management, USB-C connectivity, and enhanced power control with dual SEPIC switching regulators. Additional features such as configurable SMD buttons, battery monitoring, and independent power source control make this board highly versatile. The design files are ready for manufacturing through JLCPCB or PCBWay.

## Assembly and Testing

### Physical Assembly
The board was assembled using through-hole and surface-mount components. Special attention was paid to the orientation and placement of key components to ensure that the layout matches the design.

### Electrical Testing
After assembly the boards, the following tests:
- **Continuity Tests:** Ensured that all connections were properly made without any shorts or open circuits.
- **Power-On Test:** Verified the correct voltage outputs (5V and 3.3V) with no significant voltage drops.
- **Load Testing:** The board was tested under different loads to verify that it could maintain stable output voltage without overheating or overloading the components.



## Future Work
Currently, we are working on miniaturizing the design further to make it suitable for portable applications. The next iteration will focus on reducing size while maintaining power efficiency and stability.
