[![Altium Designer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Altium-21.0-blue.svg)](https://www.altium.com/)

## Overview
This project involves a custom PCB design in Altium Designer, an enhanced version of the MB102 power supply module. It improves upon the original design in terms of power stability, noise reduction, and enhanced safety features. The design files are fully prepared for manufacturing with JLCPCB or PCBWay, making it easy to replicate or modify the board.

- **Dynamic Power Path Management:** Integrated LiPo battery charger with dynamic power path management for optimized power distribution.
- **USB-C Connector:** Upgraded to a USB-C connector for modern power and data interfaces.
- **Power Control:** Equipped with a switch for complete device shutdown.
- **Configurable Buttons:** SMD buttons configurable with pull-down or pull-up resistors.
- **Advanced Power Regulation:** SEPIC-type switching regulators providing stable 5V and 3.3V outputs.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Added a 3.3V LDO for projects utilizing microcontroller sleep modes.
- **Battery Monitoring:** Battery level measurement using a resistive divider controlled by MOSFETs for accurate readings.
- **Battery Status Indicator:** Pin and indicator for battery status notifications (charging or fully charged).
- **Independent Power Control:** Pins available to individually enable or disable each switching regulator (3.3V or 5V).

## Assembly and Testing

### Physical Assembly
The board was assembled using through-hole and surface-mount components. Special attention was paid to the orientation and placement of key components to ensure that the layout matches the design in Altium.

### Electrical Testing
After receiving the boards, the following tests were conducted:
- **Continuity Tests:** Ensured that all connections were properly made without any shorts or open circuits.
- **Power-On Test:** Verified the correct voltage outputs (5V and 3.3V) with no significant voltage drops.
- **Load Testing:** The board was tested under different loads to verify that it could maintain stable output voltage without overheating or overloading the components.



## Future Work
Currently, we are working on miniaturizing the design further to make it suitable for portable applications. The next iteration will focus on reducing size while maintaining power efficiency and stability.
